# Task Management Board
- This project is a frontend assignment by GreenStitch.io.

This is a simple task management board built using React.js and `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality. It allows users to create new tasks and move tasks between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns. 

## Features
- **Create New Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with a title and description.
- **Drag and Drop**: Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns.
- **Column Restrictions**: Tasks can only be moved from "To Do" to "In Progress" and from "In Progress" to "Done".
